        <p>Indira Gandhi International Airport, situated to the south-west of Delhi, is the main gateway
           for the city's domestic and international civilian air traffic. In 2015-16, the airport handled
          more than 48 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in India and South Asia.
          Terminal 3, which cost ₹96.8 billion (US$1.2 billion) to construct between 2007 and 2010, handles
          an additional 37 million passengers annually. In 2010, IGIA was conferred the 4th best airport
          award in the world in the 15-25 million category, by Airports Council International. The airport
          was rated as the Best airport in the world in the 25-40 million passengers category in 2015, by
          Airports Council International. Delhi Airport was awarded The Best Airport in Central Asia and 
          Best Airport Staff in Central Asia at the Skytrax World Airport Awards 2015.[ Hindon Domestic 
          Airport in Ghaziabad was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the second airport for 
          the Delhi-NCR Region on 8 March 2019.</p>

          <p>Delhi has the highest road density of 2103 km/100 km2 in India. It is connected to other 
            parts of India by five National Highways: NH 1, NH 2, NH 8, NH 10 and NH 24. The Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Kolkata 
            prongs of the Golden Quadrilateral start from the city. The city's road network is maintained by MCD, NDMC, Delhi 
            Cantonment Board, Public Works Department (PWD) and Delhi Development Authority.

            <br>
            Buses are the most popular means of road transport catering to about 60% of Delhi's total demand.
            Delhi has one of India's largest bus transport systems. In 1998, the Supreme Court of India ruled 
            that all public transport vehicles in Delhi must be fuelled by compressed natural gas (CNG) to tackle 
            increasing vehicular pollution. The state-owned Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) is a major bus service
            provider which operates the world's largest fleet of CNG-fuelled buses. In addition, cluster scheme Buses
            are operated by Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) with the participation of private 
            concessionaires and DTC. In December 2017, the DTC and cluster buses carried over 4.19 million passengers per day.
            Kashmiri Gate ISBT, Anand Vihar ISBT and Sarai Kale Khan ISBT are the main bus terminals for outstation 
            buses plying to neighbouring states. Delhi's rapid rate of economic development and population growth has 
            resulted in an increasing demand for transport, creating excessive pressure on the city's transport
            infrastructure. To meet the transport demand, the State and Union government constructed a mass rapid
            transit system, including the Delhi Metro. Delhi Bus Rapid Transit System runs between
            Ambedkar Nagar and Delhi Gate.
            <br>
            Personal vehicles especially cars also form a major chunk of vehicles plying on Delhi roads. As of 2007,
            private vehicles account for 30% of the total demand for transport. Delhi has the highest number of
            registered cars compared to any other metropolitan city in India. Taxis, auto rickshaws, and cycle
            rickshaws also ply on Delhi roads in large numbers. As of 2008, the number of vehicles in the metropolitan 
            region, Delhi NCR, was 11.2 million (11.2 million). In 2008, there were 85 cars in Delhi for every
            1,000 of its residents.In 2017, the number of vehicles in Delhi city alone crossed the ten million 
            mark with the transport department of Delhi Government putting the total number of registered vehicles 
            at 10,567,712 until 25 May of the year.</p>

         <p>Delhi is a major junction in the Indian railway network and is the headquarters of the Northern Railway.
            The main railway stations are New Delhi, Old Delhi, Hazrat Nizamuddin, Anand Vihar, Delhi Sarai Rohilla and
            Delhi Cantt. The Delhi Metro, a mass rapid transit system built and operated by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), 
            serves many parts of Delhi and the neighbouring cities Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida.[185] As of December 2021,
            the metro consists of ten operational lines with a total length of 348.12 km (216.31 mi) and 254 stations, and several 
            other lines are under construction.The Phase-I was built at a cost of US$2.3 billion and the Phase-II was expected 
            to cost an additional ₹216 billion (US$2.7 billion).Phase-II has a total length of 128 km and was completed by 2010. 
            Delhi Metro completed 10 years of operation on 25 December 2012. It carries millions of passengers every day.
            In addition to the Delhi Metro, a suburban railway, the Delhi Suburban Railway exists.</p>
            <h3><li>Metro</li></h3>

        <p> The Delhi Metro is a rapid transit system serving Delhi, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida in the National
            Capital Region of India. Delhi Metro is the world's tenth-largest metro system in terms of length. Delhi Metro was 
            India's second modern public transportation system. The network consists of 10 colour-coded lines serving 255
            stations with a total length of 348.12 kilometres (216.31 mi).[d] The system has a mix of underground, at-grade, 
            and elevated stations using both broad-gauge and standard-gauge. All stations have escalators, lifts, and tactile 
            tiles to guide the visually impaired from station entrances to trains. There are 18 designated parking sites at
            Metro stations to further encourage the use of the system. In March 2010, DMRC partnered with Google India 
            (through Google Transit) to provide train schedule and route information to mobile devices with Google Maps.
            It has a combination of elevated, at-grade, and underground lines, and uses both broad gauge and standard 
            gauge rolling stock. Four types of rolling stock are used: Mitsubishi-ROTEM Broad gauge, Bombardier MOVIA,
            Mitsubishi-ROTEM Standard gauge, and CAF Beasain Standard gauge. The Phase-I of Delhi Metro was built for 
            US$2.3 billion and the Phase-II was expected to cost an additional ₹216 billion (US$2.7 billion).
            Phase-II has a total length of 128 km and was completed by 2010. Delhi Metro completed 10 years of 
            operation on 25 December 2012. It carries millions of passengers every day.

             <br><br>
            Delhi Metro is being built and operated by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC), 
            a state-owned company with equal equity participation from the Government of India and the Government 
            of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. However, the organization is under the administrative control 
            of the Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India. Besides the construction and operation of the 
            Delhi Metro, DMRC is also involved in the planning and implementation of metro rail, monorail, and high-speed 
            rail projects in India and providing consultancy services to other metro projects in the country as well
            as abroad. The Delhi Metro project was spearheaded by Padma Vibhushan E. Sreedharan, the managing director
            of DMRC and popularly known as the "Metro Man" of India. He famously resigned from DMRC taking moral responsibility
            for a metro bridge collapse, which took five lives. Sreedharan was awarded the Legion of Honour by the French 
            Government for his contribution to Delhi Metro</p>
