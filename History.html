          <p>Delhi has a long history, and has been an important political centre of India as the
            capital of several empires. Earliest coverage of Delhi's history is in the onset of
            the Tomar's kingdom in the 8th century. It is considered to be a city built, destroyed
            and rebuilt several times, as outsiders who successfully invaded the Indian Subcontinent
            would ransack the existing capital city in Delhi, and those who came to conquer and stay
            would be so impressed by the city's strategic location as to make it their capital and 
            rebuild it in their own way.
            <br>
            In the medieval era, Delhi was ruled by the Tomara dynasty and Chauhan from 736 to 1193.
            The Delhi Sultanate is the name given for a series of five successive dynasties, which
            remained as a dominant power of Indian subcontinent with Delhi as their capital.
            <br>
            During Sultanate period, the city became a center for culture. The Delhi Sultanate came 
            to an end in 1526, when Babur defeated the forces of the last Lodi sultan, Ibrahim Lodi at 
            the first Battle of Panipat, and formed the Mughal Empire.

            <br>
            The Mughals ruled the area for three centuries. During the 16th century, the city declined as
            the Mughal capital was shifted. The fifth Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan built the walled city of 
            hahjahanabad within Delhi, and its landmarks, the Red Fort and Jama Masjid. His reign would be 
            considered the zenith of the empire. After the death of his successor Aurangzeb, the Mughal Empire 
            was plagued by a series of revolts. They lost major portions to the Marathas, Sikhs and many 
            governors of erstwhile Mughal provinces like Bengal, Awadh and Hyderabad. Delhi was sacked and 
            looted by Nader Shah.The Jats captured many important towns of Mughal heartland south of Delhi.
            The Marathas captured Delhi in the battle of Delhi in 1757 and continued to control it unti 1803
            when they were defeated by the British during the second Anglo-Maratha War. In 1803, the Delhi 
            was captured by the British East India Company.
            <br>        
            During Company Rule in India, the Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah II was reduced to merely a figurehead.
            The Indian Rebellion of 1857 sought to end company rule and declared Bahadur Shah II the Emperor of
            India. However, the British soon recaptured Delhi and their other territories, ending the short-lived
            rebellion. This also marked the beginning of direct British Rule in India. In 1911, the capital of
            British India was shifted from Calcutta to New Delhi, the last inner city of Delhi designed by Edwin Lutyens.
           
           After India's Independence from the British, New Delhi became the capital of the newly formed Republic of India.</p>

          <p>The early modern period in Indian history is marked with the rise of the 
            Mughal Empire between the 16th and 18th centuries. After the fall of the 
            Delhi Sultanate, the Mughals ruled from Agra, Sikri and Lahore, but the 
            city once became the capital in 1648 during the rule of Shah Jahan, and 
            remained the capital until the fall of the empire. During this time, Delhi 
            became a center for culture, and poets such as Ghalib, Dard, Dagh and Zauq 
            lived in the city and sought patronage of the emperor. The Mughals also built
            several monuments in the city including Humayun's Tomb, Red Fort, and Jama Masjid.</p>
          
          <h3><li>Post-Independence (1947-present)</li></h3> 
           <p>During the partition of India, around five lakh Hindu and Sikh refugees, mainly from West Punjab 
            fled to Delhi, while around three lakh Muslim residents of the city migrated to Pakistan. Ethnic
            Punjabis are believed to account for at least 40% of Delhi's total population and are predominantly
            Hindi-speaking Punjabi Hindus.Migration to Delhi from the rest of India continues (as of 2013),
            contributing more to the rise of Delhi's population than the birth rate, which is declining.
           <br>
            The States Reorganisation Act, 1956 created the Union Territory of Delhi from its predecessor, the Chief 
            Commissioner's Province of Delhi.The Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 declared the Union Territory
            of Delhi to be formally known as the National Capital Territory of Delhi. The Act gave Delhi its own legislative 
            assembly along Civil lines, though with limited powers.
            <br>

            After 1967 relations between Hindus and Muslims deteriorated to the level that there was a significant uptick in 
            the number of riots and other disruption of civil life. One of the most significant was the 1973 riot in Bao Hindu
            Rao area, which resulted in the injury of 18 police officers and financial losses estimated to be around 500,000 Rupees,
            according to police sources. Another significant riot happened on 5 May 1974 in the Sadar Bazar area between Hindus and
            Muslims in which 11 people were killed and 92 were injured. This riot was the worst in Delhi since independence.
            The Centre for the Study of Developing Societies carried out a survey in nearby areas that showed significant division
            between Hindus and Muslims who saw each other negatively.
            <br>
            In 1966, an inscription of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (273-236 BCE) was discovered near Sriniwaspuri. Two sandstone pillars 
            inscribed with the edicts of Ashoka were brought to by Firuz Shah Tughluq in the 14th century already exist in Delhi.</p>
