        <h2>Festival in Delhi</h2>
        <IMG SRC="https://www.tripsavvy.com/thmb/6l3X2R-YT2mLb7c-fuy5IQRWLYo=/3862x2578/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/woman-arranging-oil-lamps-on-rangoli-during-diwali--874915360-5a2aad7ec7822d0037130683.jpg"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=30% WDTH=30%>
        <p>Delhi's association and geographic proximity to the capital, New Delhi, has amplified the importance
             of national events and holidays like Republic Day, Independence Day (15 August) and Gandhi Jayanti. 
             On Independence Day, the Prime Minister addresses the nation from the Red Fort. The Republic Day Parade 
             is a large cultural and military parade showcasing India's cultural diversity and military strength.
             Over the centuries, Delhi has become known for its composite culture, and a festival that symbolises this is 
             the Phool Walon Ki Sair, which takes place in September. Flowers and pankhe—fans embroidered with flowers—are
             offered to the shrine of the 13th-century Sufi saint Khwaja Bakhtiyar Kaki and the Yogmaya Temple, 
             both situated in Mehrauli.
        <br>
        Religious festivals include Diwali (the festival of lights), Mahavir Jayanti, Guru Nanak's Birthday, Raksha Bandhan, Durga Puja, Holi, Lohri, Chauth, Krishna Janmastami, Maha Shivratri, Eid ul-Fitr, Moharram and Buddha Jayanti.[228] The Qutub Festival is a cultural event during which performances of musicians and dancers from all over India are showcased at night, with the Qutub Minar as a backdrop.[230] Other events such as Kite Flying Festival, International Mango Festival and Vasant Panchami (the Spring Festival) are held every year in Delhi. The Auto Expo, Asia's largest auto show,[231] is held in Delhi biennially. The New Delhi World Book Fair, held biennially at the Pragati Maidan, is the second-largest exhibition of books in the world.[232] Delhi is often regarded as the "Book Capital" of India because of high readership.[233] India International Trade Fair (IITF), organised by ITPO is the biggest cultural and shopping fair of Delhi which takes place in November each year and is visited by more than 1.5 million people</p>
