        <p>As a first-level administrative division, the National Capital Territory of Delhi has its own Legislative Assembly,
           Lieutenant Governor, the council of ministers, and Chief Minister. Members of the legislative assembly are directly 
           elected from territorial constituencies in the NCT. The legislative assembly was abolished in 1956, after which direct
           federal control was implemented until it was re-established in 1993. The Municipal corporation handles civic administration 
           for the city as part of the Panchayati Raj Act. The Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of 
           Delhi jointly administer New Delhi, where both bodies are located. The Parliament of India, the Rashtrapati Bhavan 
           (Presidential Palace), Cabinet Secretariat, and the Supreme Court of India are located in the municipal district of 
           New Delhi. There are 70 assembly constituencies and seven Lok Sabha (Indian parliament's lower house) constituencies 
           in Delhi.The Indian National Congress (Congress) formed all the governments in Delhi until the 1990s, when 
           the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Madan Lal Khurana, came to power. In 1998, the Congress returned to power 
           under the leadership of Sheila Dikshit, who was subsequently re-elected for 3 consecutive terms. But in 2013, the Congress 
           was ousted from power by the newly formed Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) led by Arvind Kejriwal forming the government with outside
           support from the Congress. However, that government was short-lived, collapsing only after 49 days. Delhi was 
           then under President's rule until February 2015. On 10 February 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party returned to power after a 
           landslide victory, winning 67 out of the 70 seats in the Delhi Legislative Assembly.</p>
