          <p>You can shop till you drop and it still won't be enough for your heart's desire. One of the many great things
              about Delhi is its wide variety of street markets to shop from, where the malls and posh showrooms take a backseat
              and are replaced with makeshift shops. Street shopping, commonly known as patri shopping is something almost 
              every Delhi girl is well versed with. If you're comfortable enough to step into crowded galis, get your bargaining
              game on, thenyou're going to have an amazing adventure while you shop in these street markets. Finding something 
              that can make your day instantly won't be a wonder.
            <br>
             Whether you're looking for clothes, shoes, accessories, electronics or handicrafts, you can find it all on the streets.
             Its true that shopping in a mall is a comfortable experience, but you'll have the best shopping experience on the very
             streets of Delhi. These places always have cute things for sale that don't pinch your pocket all that much. We have
             come up with a handy list of all the street markets you can hit for the best shopping experience
